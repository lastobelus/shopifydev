 # switch command

Z(2013.06.06):
  M, I think you should work on memoizing the shop array and the 'refresh'
  command. That lag is killing me.

  You should take a look at switch.handle_choices and switch.handle_by_shop_type
  I realized that the object we are calling @cfg is either:
    a string, in which case we should keep going
    a result object, in which case we should switch shops

  So, in handle_choice we determine whether we present a new menu, or go
  ahead and update the current shop

  The result object gets a key "shop_type" that lets us know how to deal
  with it. The behaviour for test_shop is already there, but if you could
  implement the behaviour for local, I would be happy

  I wrote a bunch of comments around the commands.rb file, too, so feel free
  to read those

M: should be some shortcuts

  switch cronin

  should look for shops in an app

  switch with no arguments
  you get a list:

  test shops:
  1. cronin

  apps (development):
  1. metafieldseditor
  2. shipping

  apps (heroku):
  1. metafieldseditor
  2. shipping

Z: _pry_.switch
  Switch is a class, and every instance of Pry has an instance of Switch. This way we can
  access _pry_.switch. In the global scope there will be an object called 'switch' that will
  be an alias to _pry_.switch so that we can call its public methods. There will also be a 
  command 'switch' that will be a wrapper for the _pry_.switch methods for displaying and
  handling a menu.

  So we can do

  `[1] pry(main)> switch`

  to present a menu of options and then

  `[1] pry(main)> switch 3`

  to choose one of them. This command just refers to methods on Pry.Switch in its process definition

  Or we can use tab completion to present the menu by invoking switch as a global object.

  ````
  [1] pry(main)> switch.m[TAB]
  switch.metafieldseditor switch.morfars-metafields
  [2] pry(main)> switch.mo[TAB]rfars-metafields
  ````

  to accomplish the same.

   - When you use switch by itself, with no args, then _pry_.switch gets reset to the first menu
   - each time you make a choice, this advances _pry_.switch to the next menu

  So in a deep menu we might see:

  ````
  [1] pry(main)> switch
  current shop: none

  Heroku Apps
  1. right app
  2. wrong app
  [1] pry(main)> switch 2
  current shop: none

  Wrong App
  1. not ok
  2. something
  [1] pry(main)> switch
  current shop: none

  Heroku Apps
  1. right app
  2. wrong app
  [1] pry(main)> switch 1
  current shop: none

  Wrong App
  1. another thing
  2. the thing you wanted
  [1] pry(main)> switch 2
  current shop: none switching to "the thing you wanted"...
  ````

# Menu of Shops in local apps
- [x] run rake shops in chosen local app
- [x] display result of rake shops in a menu
- [x] how do we handle this? do we use letters? or does switch command remember state (which menu was displayed last)? ie, what does ```switch 1``` mean? 
- [ ] memoize results of rake shops in a hash with same keys as the apps have in config (I would put this in config). This is because running rake shops is slow enough to be annoying.
- [ ] add -r,--refresh option to switch command to tell it to get fresh data
- [ ] deploy apps with shopify_dev gem
  - [ ] metafieldseditor              richard@webifytechnology.com

# Switch should reload last client. If it has been less than 30 minutes, automatically. If it has been more than 30 minutes, ask [y/n/s]
